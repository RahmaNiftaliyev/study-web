# Flexbox Froggy - A game for learning CSS flexbox

> ## Excerpt
> A game for learning CSS flexbox

The frogs are spread all over the pond, but the lilypads are bunched at the top. You can use `align-content` to set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other. This property takes the following values:

-   `flex-start`: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
-   `flex-end`: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
-   `center`: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
-   `space-between`: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
-   `space-around`: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
-   `stretch`: Lines are stretched to fit the container.

This can be confusing, but `align-content` determines the spacing between lines, while `align-items` determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container. When there is only one line, `align-content` has no effect.

```
#pond {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;

```

```
}
```
